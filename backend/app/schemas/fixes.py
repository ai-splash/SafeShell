"""
Pydantic schemas for the AI One-Click Fix Engine.

Detection responses are defined here. Preparing a fix reuses
`CommandPreviewResponse` from `schemas/commands.py` directly (the exact
same shape returned by /api/commands/generate and /api/commands/explain),
and confirming/executing a fix reuses the existing /api/commands endpoints
unchanged - no new execution schema is needed.
