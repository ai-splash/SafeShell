"""
AI Linux Operations Assistant - orchestration layer.

Pipeline for every user query:
  1. Understand user intent       -> intent_classifier.classify_intent()
  2. Gather relevant system info  -> context_builder.build_context()
  3. Build context                -> prompts.build_user_prompt()
  4. Send context to an LLM       -> ollama_client.chat()
  5. Return explanation, recommended commands, confidence score, reasoning

For everything except the Sprint 9 tool-grounded fast path described
below, the assistant NEVER executes commands - it only reads system state
(via psutil, in context_builder.py) and asks the LLM to recommend commands
as text for the user to review and run themselves.

Conversation history is persisted per session_id in SQLite
(conversation_store.py) and replayed back into the prompt on subsequent
turns so the assistant has short-term memory of the conversation.

Sprint 9 adds a tool-grounded fast path: before any of the above runs,
`ops_intent_classifier.classify_ops_intent()` checks whether the question
is one of the specific, high-precision ops questions this copilot can
answer from a real, whitelisted, read-only command (top CPU/memory
processes, disk usage, running/failed services, recent/error logs,
listening ports). If it is, `ops_assistant.process_ops_query()` runs
instead: it executes the command for real (`tool_executor.py`), grounds
the LLM prompt in that live data, and returns a response carrying the same
fields as before plus `tool_used` and `detailed_results`. Anything that
doesn't match one of those specific tools falls through to the original
psutil-based, explanation-only pipeline below, unchanged.
